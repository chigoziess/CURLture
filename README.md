CURLture helps users create and save personalized hair profiles throughout the year, tracking how their hair changes with the seasons. You can log the state of your hair, the products that worked for you, and notes on what you liked or didn’t like. It’s especially valuable for Black women, whose hair often reacts differently depending on the environment. The app makes it easy to keep detailed records not just for yourself, but also for your kids or anyone else you care for—because finding the right products shouldn’t be a guessing game.

Keep an organized hair profile list with ease. This gives the ability to see what time of the year the profile was added and choose based on that to be able to make comparisons.
Within the profile, you can save hair type, porosity, products used, and notes. There’s also a photo that shows up depicting the hair type and a description of it to guide you with products to consider.
You can save and add to the list, delete from the list, edit the items in the list, etc.
The hair type and porosity can be chosen with pickers.And the date can be chosen with a calendar. 
There’s a different color scheme for dark mode. And also, if you have no notes, it shows up as “n/a”.
